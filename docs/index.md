## Motivation
As you've probably read before, I'm currently Master I in the game. At that level, vibe-guessing (a.k.a. `this grass looks Mongolian`) doesn't cut it anymore, and some country/region-specific hints appear reliably enough that learning them can win you that 4.5x multi round. These notes are compiled through my games playing NM/NMPZ at Master I/II levels: low-hanging fruit that you remember from losing that one deciding round, or playing a few practice maps.

## Who might benefit from this

Myself mostly. I learn something better when I note it down, which is why I made this page lol. Regardless, anyone from Gold I and up can read and learn a lot of new things to bring into their game. This list is non-exhaustive, I will keep updating it as I play.
