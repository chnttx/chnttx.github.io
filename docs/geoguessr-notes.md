# GeoGuessr country/region-guessing notes

## Motivation

As you've probably read before, I'm currently Master I in the game. At that level, vibe-guessing (a.k.a. `this grass looks Mongolian`) doesn't cut it anymore, and some country/region-specific hints appear reliably enough that learning them can win you that 4.5x multi round. These notes are compiled through my games playing NM/NMPZ at Master I/II levels: low-hanging fruit that you remember from losing that one deciding round, or playing a few practice maps.

## Who might benefit from this

Myself mostly. I learn something better when I note it down, which is why I made this page lol. Regardless, anyone from Gold I and up can read and learn a lot of new things to bring into their game. This list is non-exhaustive, I will keep updating it as I play.

## let's start?

### Australia

- Tropical vegetation + wide open roads probably means you're in Queensland, drier = more inland and vice versa. Far North Queensland (Cairns area) is **very** tropical (palm trees + dark green vegetation + mountains). Sugarcane plantations are also good North Queensland signal.
- Yellow number plates are exclusively NSW. While you might see NSW-registered cars in other states as well, and the state does have multiple number plate designs, if you see multiple yellow plates, then there's a very high chance you're in NSW.
- Utility poles in Melbourne feature white rectangular stickers with smaller blue square inside it.
