## Queensland (QLD)

- Tropical vegetation + wide open roads probably means you're in Queensland, drier = more inland and vice versa. Far North Queensland (Cairns area) is **very** tropical (palm trees + dark green vegetation + mountains). Sugarcane plantations are also good North Queensland signal.
- If you see a school with "... State School" or "... State High School", then you're in Queensland.
- Buses are very common in Brisbane/SEQ area. They're yellow, and sometimes can find them in white/green liveries as well.

## New South Wales (NSW)

- Yellow number plates are exclusively NSW. While you might see NSW-registered cars in other states as well, and the state does have multiple number plate designs, if you see multiple yellow plates, then there's a very high chance you're in NSW.
