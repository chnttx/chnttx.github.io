    <p>I'm 21. Currently I'm working as a Software Engineer at Luxury Escapes, and prior to that I interned at CSIRO's Australian e-Health Research Centre.</p>
    <p>I live in Sydney, Australia. My usual coffee order is a large flat white, and sometimes with oat milk if I'm feeling good. I give the barista either "Harry" or "July" as my name.</p>
    <p>I made this website to put on my LinkedIn, so I’d have an excuse to send more connection requests. I want more people checking out my website. I try to work on my own projects outside of work as well - it complements my work, and vice versa.</p>
    <p>I really hate going through websites or PowerPoint slide decks that have too much unnecessary blocking animations - it’s like having a 2 second red light every 5 seconds. I want you to know as much about me in as little time as possible.</p>
    <p>I’m currently Master I on GeoGuessr. I try to write detailed region-guessing notes for each country. Hopefully you can learn something from them.</p>
    <p>I’m a casual road cyclist, and now I’m starting out running. I read books on the train.</p>
